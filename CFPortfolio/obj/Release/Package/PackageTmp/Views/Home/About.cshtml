                <p>My name is Aaron Rowan.  I am a web developer in the Charlotte, NC area.  I work in Microsoft .NET technologies inclulding C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET.  Naturally, I am also very familiar with a wide range of front end tools: JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3, HTML5, AJAX.  I've spent a great deal of time developing and interacting with back end tools: SQL Server (both Microsoft and Oracle).  My hobby work has included C with the Arduino and some wireless communication protocols for the XBee.</p>
                <p>I’ve been programming since I was 5 years old on my family’s Tandy TRS80 Color Computer 2.  The true PC prototype, this unit used our TV and had it’s 5 ½” floppy drive connected via an external ribbon cable.  I created programs in BASIC to create simple, interactive images on the screen and output and modulate sound.  </p>
                <p>Thus far in my career, I have focused on developing streamlined and efficient processes.  I’ve been developing my IT skills through my extensive project and process work, developing a number of applications specifically designed to the needs of my employers.  Now in Charlotte, I’m presented with a healthy job market and an opportunity to really focus on the skills I have been less formally developing for the past 30 years.</p>
                <p>I love solving problems and have had some excellent success volunteering.  I was the lead engineering mentor for a regional high school robotics team.  We received the rookie achievement award for our dedication and relentless approach to creating and maintaining our robot throughout the Philadelphia Alliance Regional at Drexel University.</p>

                                    <p>My Bachelors of Science from RPI provides a firm technical foundation but is only a small part of my education.  From AP English in high school to playing football in college while taking up to 21 credits, I have always reached beyond my comfort zone to develop myself.  This tradition has continued through my professional career through my MBA, and multiple certifications.  </p>

                                    <p>I have had a lot of success managing projects for process improvement.  I managed a key project to develop an energy management dashboard.  Working with a local developer, I provided the requirements, architecture and all of the SQL queries required.  The queries pulled from both SQL server as well as Oracle databases of varying ages.  </p>

                                    <p>My project work has allowed me to have a tremendous effect on the environmental footprint of an entire industry early in my career.  Working with our organization's metallurgists, operations, and purchasing teams I identfied a key change to our products that would enable us to use significantly more recycled material.  The net effect was to reduce our company's Carbon Footprint by an amount equivalent to 200,000 cars per year.  (as well as save $8 Million)</p>
